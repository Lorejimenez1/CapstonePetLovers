# The Motivation
According to the 2017-2018 National Pet Owners Survey conducted by the American Pet Products Association (APPA).
85 million  U.S families, own a pet. First hand i know most everyone loves pets and how useful an adoption app can be.
My vision was creating an app to find a specific animal and or breed in your area. Then receive all the detailed info to be able to adopt that pet into your home. and to further the love of pets i decided to establish a simple api and database for events related to pets. So users can receive upcoming events related to pets like adoptions or fundraisers for a cause

### How It Works
#### For petfinder
+ Enter your zipcode, what kind of animal your loooking for and you can but it is not neccesary to ento the breed of the animal
